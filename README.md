# 737 Cockpit

This is somewhat of a "passion project". Personally, I like panels with lots of buttons and I like knowing how to operate them. I love aviation an equal amount.
So, sometimes, I want to noodle around and practice starting up the Boeing 737-800 from cold and dark without actually launching X-Plane 11 or MSFS 2020.

Enter ***737 Cockpit***!

## Goal
The goal of ***737 Cockpit*** is to provide a little mini-game of sorts that offers a true to life start up procedure with **100%** accuracy and guided sessions
for aspiring pilots (real world or sim) to practice starting up the aircraft and getting it ready to taxi! The aim is to be able to do this without requiring the purchase or installation
of a much larger sim such as X-Plane 11 or Microsoft Flight Simulator.

***737 Cockpit*** will offer fully modeled 737 panels, switches, and systems that function properly. While we're starting with just the panels - the end goal is a
fully modeled, enclosed cockpit. But the bottom-line is if you see something that looks like it should do something - it does something.
